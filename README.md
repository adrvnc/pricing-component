## My Process


### Built With 

- HTML 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
- JavaScript 
### What I Learned 

While working on this project, I familiarzed myself `for` loops, `if` statements, and variable declarations.

### Continued Development 

I want to become better acquainted with VanillaJS as I build future projects. 


### Useful Resources 

 - [Var, Let, and Const â€“ What's the Difference?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/) - This article helped me understand why `let` is preferred for variable declaration instead of `var`. 
## Acknowledgements

I want to give a shoutout to Muhammad Asif's [Solution](https://codeconvey.com/pricing-table-with-css-switch-toggle/).
I used and modified his javascript code which helped me create a 
working toggle switch to change the pricing. 

```js
function priceChange() {
  let toggleSwitch = document.getElementById("toggleSwitch");
  let price1 = document.getElementsByClassName("price1");
  let price2 = document.getElementsByClassName("price2");

  for (let i = 0; i < price1.length; i++) {
    if (toggleSwitch.checked == true) {
      price1[i].style.display = "block";
      price2[i].style.display = "none";
    } else if (toggleSwitch.checked == false) {
      price1[i].style.display = "none";
      price2[i].style.display = "block";
    }
  }
}
priceChange();
```
